   <h2>üßÆ Scoring System üßÆ</h2>
 </p>
</div>
<br>

The Echo scoring system evaluates how effectively an Echo's substats align with a character‚Äôs needs. Each relevant substat is assigned a weight based on the target character‚Äôs build preferences‚ÄîDPS units might favor CRIT Rate and ATK%, while supports lean toward Energy Regen or HP%.

To compute the score, each substat is compared to its maximum possible roll and scaled accordingly:

```
(statValue / maxPossibleValue) √ó statWeight
```

The final Echo score is the sum of all weighted substats, normalized on a 0‚Äì100 scale. This approach allows for consistent scoring and comparison across gear.

The optimization module elevates WuWa Optimizer from a scoring utility to a full recommendation engine.

### How Optimization Works

Each Echo in your inventory is evaluated not just by its current stats, but also by its **potential**. Echoes that haven't reached 5 substats have their missing rolls simulated using all valid stat combinations and realistic roll value distributions.

For each possible completion, the optimizer computes a score based on the target character‚Äôs stat priorities. It then:

- Determines the **maximum theoretical score** of the Echo
- Estimates the **expected score** based on RNG likelihood
- Compares against your other Echoes to suggest the **optimal set**

The system accounts for 2-piece and 5-piece set bonuses, slot types, and potential stat distributions to build the best-performing configuration for each character.
